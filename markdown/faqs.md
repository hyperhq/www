# FAQ

----------

## Q: Does Hyper use Linux containers?
No, Hyper is a ***pure hypervisor-based*** solution. It does not require any container technology (Docker daemon, LXC, Cgroup, Namespace), except ***`MOUNT`*** namespace for [Pods](http://docs.hypercontainer.io/get_started/pod.html).

## Q: Which hypervisors are supported?
Hyper is ***hypervisor agnostic***. Currently Hyper supports KVM, Xen, VirtualBox (Mac OS X), and more options on the roadmap.

## Q: What are the performances of Hyper?

- Boot: Start a hyper Pod only takes less than 350 millisecond.
- CPU: CPU Performance overhead is about 0.4 percent.
- Mem: Memory Performance overhead is about 0.64 percent.

## Q: Which kernel versions are available with Hyper?
The current release of Hyper uses [kernel stable 4.0.1](https://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.0.1). Please note that you can configure Hyper to use ***any compatible Linux kernel***, though those might be slow and demand more resources.


## Q: Compare with CoreOS or RancherOS?
CoreOS and RancherOS are two popular minimalist Linux distributions built for running app containers. Though primarily designed for bare metal server, they are commonly used as Guest OS in the cloud, due to the lack of isolation in containers. Hyper, on the other hand, ***eliminates the need of a Guest OS***, by leveraging the hardware-enforced isolation in the hypervisor.

With that said, we see Hyper as one form of *Containerization*. We would like to integrate Hyper with the minimalist Linux distros.

## Q: Compare with Intel ClearContainer?
Hyper and Clear Container (CC) share the similar idea of: ***hypervisor-based AppC runtime***. The current release of CC supports rkt only; and Hyper currently supports Docker only. Also,

	The goal of Clear Linux OS, is to showcase the best of Intel Architecture technology, from low level kernel features to more complex items that span across the entire operating system stack.

Hyper aims to be a technology-neutral open source solution.

## Q: Compare with QBoot
QBoot is a minimal x86 firmware that runs on QEMU and, together with a slimmed-down QEMU configuration, boots a virtual machine in 40 ms on an Ivy Bridge Core i7 processor. Hyper uses QBoot as the default boot option.
